This project is a challange which about Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration (ANHIR). And this is a part of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019\.

Image alignment give the pathologist the possiblility to assess the histology and expression of multiple markers in a patient in a single region.
